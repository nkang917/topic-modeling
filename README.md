# Natural Language Processing and Topic Modeling on User Review

1. Clustered unlabeled user reviews of a watch into groups and discovered the latent semantic structures using Python.
2. Preprocessed review text by tokenization, stemming, removing stop words and extracted features by Term Frequency â€“ Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF).
3. Trained unsupervised learning models of K-means clustering and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).
4. Identified latent topics and keywords of each review for clustering.
